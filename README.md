# wormJB
wormJB is a jailbreak-like tool for iOS that supports versions 14.0 to 26.1 with any device.

## Requirements
- an Internet Connection
- an Apple device running iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later
- the [A-Shell App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438)
- the [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9821de092cb140c29a8f38862f4c99fc)

## Instructions
1. Download the Shortcut if you haven't already, along with installing A-Shell.
2. Run the Shortcut. You should click "Yes" on the first prompt unless you have not installed A-Shell.

That's it. This is a very simple process. If you mess this process up somehow then it is either a **bug** that you should report, or you are the issue.

## How it Works
The **pissra1n 2** tool is used, utilizing **liqu1dass**. This is essential for modern semi-rootless jailbreak-like tweaks.

After this, the **semi-rootless environment** will be prepared by the wormJB scripts.

## Q&A
**Q**: Is wormJB rootless or rootful?

**A**: wormJB is only a **semi-rootless** jailbreak-like tool. This means that while you have access to the root directory, it is not fully accessible, writable, or even readable. This is a catch to how the jailbreak-like method works. On top of that, the root directory is only accessible from the A-Shell app.

---

**Q**: I paid for wormJB and it doesn't work. Is this a scam?

**A**: You were scammed, wormJB is free software.

---

**Q**: Zebra did not install.

**A**: Rerun the shortcut.

---

**Q**: I can't install A-Shell from the App Store. What do I do?

**A**: Then your device cannot have jailbreak-like tweaks.

All of the projects listed in the Inspiration category are all fake and mostly scams, do NOT use them.

## Other Notes

This is mostly useless besides the fact that it does make some legitimate "tweaks" to A-Shell, but you could do these yourself with just a few commands.
