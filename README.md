# wormJB
wormJB is a jailbreak-like tool for iOS that supports versions 14.0 to 26.1 with any device.

## Requirements
- an Internet Connection
- an Apple device running iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later
- the [A-Shell App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438)
- the Shortcut (not done yet)

## Instructions
1. Download the Shortcut if you haven't already, along with installing A-Shell.
2. Run the Shortcut. You should click "Yes" on the first prompt unless you have not installed A-Shell.

That's it. This is a very simple process. If you mess this process up somehow then it is either a **bug** that you should report, or you are the issue.

## Inspiration

wormJB was inspired by:
- Jailbreak18
- Checkra1n Mirror
- unc0ver Black Edition
- Fugu17
- Ballpa1n
- Cydia Gold

## Disclaimers

This project is **for educational and experimental purposes only**.
wormJB does not actually perform any jailbreak actions, modify system partitions, or bypass security mechanisms.
Use at your own discretion.

All of the projects listed in the Inspiration category are all fake and mostly scams, do NOT use them.

## Other Notes

This is mostly useless besides the fact that it does make some legitimate "tweaks" to A-Shell, but you could do these yourself with just a few commands.
