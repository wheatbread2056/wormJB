# wormJB
wormJB is a jailbreak-like tool for iOS that supports versions 14.0 to 26.1 with any device.

wormJB has only been tested on iOS 26.0.1 with the iPhone 15. If any issues arise, you can report an issue.

*disclaimer: this is not a jailbreak, and does not exploit anything in iOS. the project is purely for entertainment and experimental purposes.*

## Requirements
- an Internet Connection
- an Apple device running iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later
- the [A-Shell App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438)
- the [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9821de092cb140c29a8f38862f4c99fc)

## Instructions
1. Download the Shortcut if you haven't already, along with installing A-Shell.
2. Run the Shortcut. You should click "Yes" on the first prompt unless you have not installed A-Shell.

That's it! Now wormJB should do its magic.

## How it Works
The **pissra1n 2** tool is used. This is essential for wormJB.

After this, the **semi-rootless environment** will be prepared by the wormJB scripts.

## Q&A
**Q**: Is wormJB rootless or rootful?

**A**: wormJB is only a **semi-rootless** jailbreak-like tool. What semi-rootless means is that you can go to the root directory (/) but you can't really go inside its folders, you can't really read or write in it, so basically you're stuck inside the A-Shell app directory, specifically ~/Documents/ (this is what A-Shell uses as the home directory)

---

**Q**: wormJB did not install.

**A**: Rerun the shortcut.

---

**Q**: I can't install A-Shell from the App Store. What do I do?

**A**: Then your device cannot be wormJBed.
