# wormJB
wormJB is a jailbreak-like tool for iOS that supports versions 14.0 to 26.1 with any device.

## Requirements
- an Internet Connection
- an Apple device running iOS/iPadOS 14.0 or later
- the [A-Shell App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438)
- the [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/9821de092cb140c29a8f38862f4c99fc)

## Instructions
1. Download the Shortcut if you haven't already, along with installing A-Shell.
2. Run the Shortcut. You should click "Yes" on the first prompt unless you have not installed A-Shell.

That's it! Now wormJB should do its magic.

## How it Works
The **pissra1n 2** tool is used. This is essential for wormJB.

After this, the **semi-rootless environment** will be prepared by the wormJB scripts.

## Q&A
**Q**: Is wormJB rootless or rootful?

**A**: wormJB is only a **semi-rootless** jailbreak-like tool. What semi-rootless means is that you can go to the root directory (/) but you can't really go inside its folders, you can't really read or write in it, so basically you're stuck inside the A-Shell app directory, specifically ~/Documents/ (this is what A-Shell uses as the home directory)
---

**Q**: wormJB did not install.

**A**: Rerun the shortcut.

---

**Q**: I can't install A-Shell from the App Store. What do I do?

**A**: Then your device cannot be wormJBed.

## Inspiration

wormJB was inspired by:
- Dopamineek
- Ballpa1n
- hammerJB

## Other Notes

This is NOT a jailbreak! This is also not useful in any way, shape, or form. There is no reason to use this. Why are you using this?
